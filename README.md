## Problem statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

## Task list

As a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.

1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Some important insights

1.	OT% - below target, IF% - below target, OTIF% - well below target. This indicates that overall supply chain service levels are significantly underperforming.
2.	Best Performer in OTIF% is Propel Mart (40.25%) followed by Atlas stores (39.55).
3.	Even stores with good OT% or IF% still struggle to hit OTIF% targets, showing inconsistency between time and quantity fulfilment.
4.	OTIF% remains stagnant between 28.6%–29.4% from March to August.
5.	Coolblue, Lotus Mart, and Acclaimed Stores clustered in low OT and IF zones
6.	Strong need for process improvement, root cause analysis, and collaboration with low-performing customers.
7.	Surat leads in OTIF and OT%, showing relatively better delivery timeliness.
8.	VOFR is healthy, but LIFR being low indicates inconsistency across line items within orders.
9.	3+ days delayed 49.16% – a major concern. Diary products are the biggest contributor to delays, and almost half the delayed orders are delayed by more than 3 days — indicating deep-rooted supply chain bottlenecks.
10.	LIFR is consistently around 63–66% across all products, while VOFR remains strong (96%+), reinforcing that full quantity is often met, but not across all items or on time.
11.	Focus on improving OTIF for top customers like Lotus Mart and Acclaimed Stores could have the highest impact on overall performance.
